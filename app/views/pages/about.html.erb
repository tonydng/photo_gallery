<h1>about</h1>
<p><a href="https://github.com/tonydng/photo_gallery">This Photo Gallery</a> is a Rails project in version 3.2.13. with <a href="https://github.com/tonydng/photo_gallery/tree/master/spec/features">full integration test</a>.
	It is also updated to the latest Rails version 4.0.0.rc1 by adding a strong_parameters gem to it. The reason is that the twitter-bootstrap-rails gem, a responsive web design helper, can not be working on Rails verson 4.0.0.rc1. The main idea of this application is that it can let a user to sign up, login, create (read, update, delete) his/her own gallery, and upload photos to this gallery. Also it can let a user to make comments about other people's photos. Beside serving for PC, this website can be viewed from any mobile phones/ipads without spending time to resize the browser window because it is a responsive website.</p>
